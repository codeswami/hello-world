Hello,this is codeswami

I like to code in c++, although I don't have too muhc knowledge in it. I'm learning python and a bit of HTML.
I'm student from CSE(Computer Science and Engineering) student. RIght now I don't know what should I be doing for the enhancement of my skills which will be good for my career. 
Hence I'm looking for oppertunities to learn and test myself in this field.
